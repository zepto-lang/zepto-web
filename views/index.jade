      Welcome. This website is about zepto, a small programming
      language. It is a Scheme derivative and compliant to most
      of R5RS. It is relaxed in those terms, though.
    p This website is currently a work in progress.

      | I suggest you check out the 
      a(href='https://github.com/zepto-lang//') github repositories 
      | while you wait.

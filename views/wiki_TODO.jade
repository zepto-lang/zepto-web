    | There are a couple of features that are to be implemented at some point or another.
    | Here is a quick and dirty list of everything I have in mind ordered by informed guesses
    | about each points' scope:

  b Small:
  ul 
    li fix single number expression (in the repl 1.5lasd is parsed as 1.5)

  b Medium:
  ul
    li Profiling shows getting variables(especially namespaced vars) takes ages(~86% of execution time). Fix that.
    li Make macros more robust
    li Fix continuations
    li Make cl libraries work
    li Hashtables (SRFI 69)
    li add traceback to errors
    li add pattern matching
    li add list comprehensions

  b Big:
  ul
    li Foreign Function Interface to C and Haskell
    li Wrap OpenGL (https://github.com/haskell-opengl/OpenGL)
    li A Compiler
      ul: li with backend targetting gpu/ptx (maybe par-define?)
    li A solid actor-based concurrency system (+ transactional memory)
